- 👋 Hi, I’m @RageQuitKitty
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring some of my many project ideas and seeing which ones I can get to take shape.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to prioritize my ideas so I don't end up with shiny-object-syndrome and a hundred outlines and incomplete projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well... not really anything at this time.
- 📫 How to reach me ... please don't. 😅
